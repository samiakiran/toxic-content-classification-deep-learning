### Mushroom Classification (edible/poisonous)


Identifying edible mushrooms from poisonous ones can be challenging due to the vast number of mushrooms and their similar characteristics. Utilizing Machine Learning, specifically classification, can aid in identifying mushrooms by finding patterns in large amounts of data. In this project, we explored the use of 4 Machine Learning techniques namely KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes and Random forest to distinguish edible mushrooms from poisonous.
